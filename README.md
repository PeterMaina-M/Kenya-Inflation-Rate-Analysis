# Kenya-Inflation-Rate-Analysis
In this project, I perform basic analysis and run a prediction model for Kenya's inflation rate.
Finally, I provided a detailed discussion on wht the results mean to the country's economy.
The Central Bank of Kenya did a commendable job in maintaining a reasonable (the recommended) inflation rate over the years.
